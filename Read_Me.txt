This is my favorite final project ever, although I officially started it on Thanksgiving.

I enjoyed the process of idealizing, searching, learning and making this stuff, because this is what I really like and fortunately I succeeded in completing it.

This is a beautiful and far-reaching science fiction, which talks about the three-body world - a planet surrounding by three suns doing mathematically unpredictable movements. The story is based on the existence of constellation of Alpha Centauri and three-body problem. Recently scientists announced that they might have found a potential earth-like planet orbiting around Alpha Centauri B, which makes Three-Body fans astonished. Actually, I’d rather believe this story is gonna be true. I strongly recommend you to read it, I bought the first book in Taiwan and the rest two in China mainland.

To finish this project, I learned a lot about Three.js, THREEX.Planets.js, Tween.js, TrackballControls.js, OribtControls.js, and some other stuff.

Finally, I only used Three.js, Tween.js and TrackballControls.js as my libraries.
As for other libraries, I learned about them and wrote the code I needed by myself.
For example, I learned THREEX.Planets.js, and wrote my own engine. Also, I added some code in TrackballControls.js to make it support camera auto rotation based on what I learned in OrbitControls.js.

Below are the resources I have consulted to:

http://nodejs.org/

To run the code on Mac OS X:
1. install node.js first
2. enter the three-body fold in terminal
3. execute command “node server”
4. open web browser (Chrome recommended)
5. go to “http://localhost:8000/three-body.html”
6. enjoy the dance of the three-body world.

To play with:
1. Use mouse to control the camera: 
	wheel for zooming
	left button for dragging
	right button for panning
	click on stars to see description, click again to close
2. Use keyboard:
	‘space’ to stop/start the revolutions of the stars
	‘A’ to start/stop the camera auto rotation
3. Recommend Shift + Command + F in Chrome to enter full screen mode.

Thank Prof.Scott Hudson, Kerry and everyone else who has ever helped me in Web Lab!
